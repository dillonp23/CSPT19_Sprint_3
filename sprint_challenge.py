"""
Exercise 1: You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST).

You need to write a function that returns the sum of values of all the nodes with a value between lower and upper (inclusive).

The BST is guaranteed to have unique values.

* Examples:

    Input:
        root = [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, null, 18]
        lower = 7
        upper = 15
        
    Output:
        32

    
    Input:
        root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6]
        lower = 6
        upper = 10
        
    Output:
        23
