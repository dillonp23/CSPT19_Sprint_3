Exercise: "104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree" (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

* Examples:

    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: 3

    Input: root = [1,null,2]
    Output: 2

    Input: root = []
    Output: 0

    Input: root = [0]
    Output: 1

Exercise: "230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST" (https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree.

* Examples:

    Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
    Output: 1


    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
    Output: 3
