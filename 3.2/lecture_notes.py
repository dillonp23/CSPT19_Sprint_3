Exercise: "104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree" (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

* Examples:

    Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
    Output: 3


    Input: root = [1,null,2]
    Output: 2


    Input: root = []
    Output: 0


    Input: root = [0]
    Output: 1
