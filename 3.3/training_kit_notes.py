Sprint 3.3 - Graphs I


Objective 1: Introduction to Graphs

* Graphs
    - collections of related data
    - similar to trees
    - connections can be made from a node to any other node in graph
    - can be in the form of a loop
    - all trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees


    * Building Blocks
        1. vertices
            - nodes in a graph are called "vertices" or "verts"
        
        2. edges
            - connections in a graph are called "edges"
            - an edge denotes a relationship or linkage between two verts


    * Useful Applications
        - can be used for a wide range of applications
        - easily represent any multi-directional relational data
        
        * examples:
            - cities and their linking roads
            - computers on a network
            - populations of people who know each other and their network ("six degrees")
            - trade relationships between countries
            - money owed in an ongoing poker tournament
