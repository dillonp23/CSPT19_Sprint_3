Sprint 3.4 - Graphs II Lecture Notes


* Traversal vs Search:
    - traversal = typically covering entire graph
    - search = typically find item, terminate early and return


* DFS vs BFS:
    - BFS = most useful for shortest/min path


* How to solve any graph problem (an UPER-like framework):

    1. translate into graph terminology
        - what are my vertices, edges and weight?

    2. how would you build a graph?
        - do you need to build it or can you use whatever input data is given to you?

    3. How to traverse/search - DFS or BFS?
        - any auxillary data needed?
        - what data do I need to store?


    * Answering these three steps will help guide you to a solution!
